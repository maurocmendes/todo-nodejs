# ToDo App

Welcome to the **ToDo App**, a command-line interface (CLI) based application for managing your tasks. This app allows you to create, list, complete, view, and delete tasks seamlessly. The tasks are stored locally in a `tasks.json` file for persistence, so your tasks will be saved across sessions.

## Features

- **Create Task**: Add new tasks with custom names.
- **List Tasks**: View all tasks and mark them as completed.
- **Completed Tasks**: View tasks that have been marked as completed.
- **Pending Tasks**: View tasks that are still pending.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are saved in a `tasks.json` file for future use.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: You need Node.js installed on your machine to run this application.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager to install dependencies.
